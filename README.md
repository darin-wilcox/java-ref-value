# A Spring Boot command line utility

This is a template for a simple command line utility with several examples:

1. Simple command line parsing
1. Pre and Post hooks for the spring app
1. A small progress utility class can be used to show a progress meter in the cli

Additional components:

1. Assembly packaging. This allows us to package as a zip file or some other packaging and packages different files for deployment.


1. The target directory will contain the expected java-ref-value.jar.
1. It will also contain java-ref-value-distribution.zip file, which wraps several other files for final distribution.
